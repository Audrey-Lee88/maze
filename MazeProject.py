#TODO:
#1A. Decide on what data structure our maze will be stored in.
#1B. Create a maze creation function (at some level of fidelity)
#2. Decide on what traversal strategies we will use
#3. Create ?3? traversal functions
#4. Create test functions that show completion times
#5. Plot comparisons between completion times
